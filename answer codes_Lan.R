#2-3 Do the bar and scatter plots tell you different stories? Why?
# Yes. Population for all groups seem to be the same in the bar plot but they are slightly different from the scatter plot.
# The reason is that bar plots mainly show the mean values, but less direct for showing the data distribution; instead, scatter plots can directly show the data distribution including outliers, but are hard to see the mean values.
